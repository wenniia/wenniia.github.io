                The Artificial Intelligence Raccoon Automaton (AIRA) is an 
                Arduino and LLM-powered robot that is able to interact with 
                its audience through sound, specifically human speech. This 
                robot is capable of holding a proper conversation, along 
                with idly humming and speaking to entertain its audience.
                By saying “hi hello” to get the robot’s attention, it will 
                respond to whatever the user says. In the case that the 
                robot is left alone, it will say certain lines periodically. 
                AIRA will reply and speak based on its insecure personality, using terms
                such as, “I hope this is satisfactory” and various 
                self-deprecating phrases. A MG996R servo is utilized to 
                make AIRA move at random intervals.

                Lastly, a reactive, 
                audiovisual environment accompanies AIRA. Using
                TouchDesigner, the real-time projection displays a 
                mosaic of monochrome dots, generated by the layered, 
                glitchy soundtrack “Be a Body” by Grimes. These distorted
                visuals function as an emotional mirror externalizing
                AIRA’s self-doubt, hesitancy, and programmed longing
                to be accepted by its audience.

                AIRA’s design encourages people to ponder whether 
                it is possible for robots to gain consciousness or 
                feel emotions. Beyond its practical applications, 
                what will it take for AI to be truly woven into the 
                social sphere and gain widespread acceptance? Aligning 
                this inquiry with our design, the robot will hide its 
                identity under an animalistic puppet, as if attempting 
                to make itself more approachable to human society by 
                warping its appearance to that of a cute, cuddly plush 
                instead of a foreign robot. Of course, the robot’s attempt 
                is not perfect–its true identity will peer through. AIRA’s 
                insecure personality serves as a double entendre, 
                illustrating how the robot is unfamiliar with human customs 
                and yet tries to garner sympathy with its self-deprecating 
                nature. Lastly, the projection visuals of swirling, 
                muted dots and rough textures mirrors AIRA’s emotional 
                hesitancy, expressing its struggle for belonging.

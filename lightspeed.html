                Inspired by Batak, Lightspeed is a high-speed reaction game where 
                the player must hit illuminated buttons as fast as possible. Batak 
                usually features a full-body board with eight buttons to hit. This 
                board’s utility has a diverse audience–from athletes in Formula 1 
                and football training their reaction time to finding its use within 
                parties and exhibitions. Our rendition capitalizes on the original 
                board’s physical interactive nature and friendly competition while 
                making the board smaller, portable, and with a lot more color.
            </p>

            <p>
                Lightspeed includes numerous parts and elements of engineering. 
                We decided to design our own hexagonal buttons as we wanted the 
                buttons’ colors to be completely changeable to our preference. Thus, 
                we designed and 3D-printed the buttons to each hold an individually- 
                addressable LED. Additionally, 3D-print was a viable candidate as we 
                expected the buttons would go through high stress as the player must 
                hit the button rapidly. As for the cover, acrylic was the best
                material on hand to reflect the random colors in a bright yet 
                slightly muted manner. As for implementing its portability and 
                accessibility, the board’s edge to edge is within arm’s reach,
                only requiring arm movement to play.

            <p>
                This game was created in mind of gathering people around an 
                enjoyable, interactive game. Ultimately, it creates a shared, 
                safe space for engagement in a good-natured contest, pivoting 
                the game as a simple yet powerful tool for social connection.

                <strong>Annie Wang</strong> is a self-taught digital artist studying Electrical Engineering at University of California, Santa Barbara.
                With a profound interest in expressing art reflecting the intricacies of light, she examines how properties of light distort and carve form, 
                altering and complicating how people understand and verify their perceptions of the real world.

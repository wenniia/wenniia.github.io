          <strong> Annie Wang</strong> is an incoming second-year studying electrical engineering at UCSB. Doubling as a self-taught
          digital artist, she enjoys using this illustrative medium as a means of expressing her interests and emotions. With a profound interest 
          in expressing art reflecting the intricacies of light, she examines how properties of light distort and carve form, altering and 
          complicating how people understand and verify their perceptions of the real world.

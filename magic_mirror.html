                The Magic Mirror is a mirror that displays and self-updates 
                with widgets of information. Taken from my to-do list, weather, 
                and calendar, the concept originates from being able to get up and 
                ready while seeing a day’s information at a glance, consolidated all 
                onto one screen. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to display the monitor, a one-way mirror was utilized so the 
                user could see their own appearance while seeing the monitor’s 
                information. The monitor’s brightness was intricately modified so the 
                display could not be seen. An external API was implemented so it 
                could pull information from the weather app, calendar, and to-do list.
                The wooden frame was cut to custom-fit around the monitor. 
                Additionally, it was painted black to blend in with the monitor. 
                Grooves were made in the wood to hold the LED strip. The LED strip’s
                customizable nature allows various “moods” of color to be displayed,
                from monochromatic hues to patterns dancing across the mirror.

                As technology becomes increasingly advanced, this project incorporates 
                the idea of how it is able to automate and make parts of our lives
                 more efficient. However, this did require a lot of access to my 
                 personal information, such as my location, what I need to do, 
                 and even how I spend my time. Ultimately, this project begs the 
                 question of where we should draw the line of integrating technology
                  and how we should use it.
